Decision Making Model (AI)


Reduced A.I to "decision making" eg, decision making systems/networks (governance?). There is a basic decision to operate sense organs for example. Prior conceptual models were based on the five senses. A model combining both would use a global dmm modula to activate each sense module, record feedback. DMM ---> Senses --> Actions ---> Feedback (loop)
